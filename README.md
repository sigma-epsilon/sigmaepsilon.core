The package contains some usefull stuff for general Python development activites that turned out to be highly reusable during developing projects in the SigmaEpsilon namespace.

Some of the most notable contents:

* Metaprogramming
  * A collection of meta and abstract base classes.
  * A `classproperty` decorator.
  * A solution to enforce abstract class properties on a class.
  * Reusable facilities for project configuration, testing, exceptions, etc.
  
* Wrapping
  * An extendible `Wrapper` class and a few factory functions to help you safely wrap objects.
